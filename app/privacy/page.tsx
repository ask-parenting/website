        <p>
          Parenting AI may process parent-provided messages and child-development context to deliver
          guidance, reminders, and milestone tracking within WhatsApp.
        </p>
        <p>
          We collect only information required to provide the service, improve response quality, and
          maintain security. We do not sell personal data.
        </p>
        <p>
          Categories of data we may process include account identifiers you share, messages, child age and
          milestone context, and usage logs required for reliability and abuse prevention.
        </p>
        <p>
          We use this data to operate the service, personalize responses, maintain safety, and improve quality.
          We do not use your data for unrelated advertising.
        </p>
        <p>
          Data may be processed by essential service providers that help us run hosting, delivery, and analytics.
          Where required, we apply contractual and technical safeguards.
        </p>
        <p>
          We retain personal data only as long as needed for service delivery, legal obligations, and security.
          Retention periods may vary by data type and legal requirement.

          We apply reasonable security controls, including encryption and access controls, to protect data.

        </p>
        <p>
          This service is intended for parents and caregivers. If you believe a child has provided personal data
          directly, contact us so we can investigate and remove it where appropriate.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Material updates will be reflected by revising
